# Secret management policy

This policy covers repository administration, GitHub Actions, local
development, documentation examples, and future release automation in
vpn-confinement. Public modules and examples must be safe to fork and inspect.

## Storage and handling

VPN provider credentials, private keys, host data, and deployment state belong
in the consumer's secret backend or in GitHub's protected repository or
environment secret stores when automation genuinely requires them. They must
never be committed, placed in the Nix store, embedded in an example, passed as
command-line arguments, or printed in logs, artifacts, tests, issues, or pull
requests.

Pull-request workflows, including workflows for forks, receive no repository
secrets. The current checks are designed to run without them. If release or
deployment automation later needs cloud access, it will use short-lived GitHub
OIDC credentials and an explicitly protected environment rather than a
long-lived key.

## Access and review

Repository administrators review Actions secrets, environments, Pages, and
future release access before granting it. Access begins at the narrowest role
needed, is individual rather than shared, and is removed when responsibility
ends. New secret use requires a pull request documenting its purpose, scope,
workflow, and failure behavior without exposing its value.

## Rotation and incident response

Secrets are rotated at least annually and immediately when a maintainer,
provider, workflow trust boundary, or authorization scope changes. Suspected
exposure triggers revocation, replacement, log and artifact review, and a
private vulnerability report or incident record. Rotation must not publish an
old or replacement value in repository history.

`security/vex.json` contains only reviewed non-affectability statements. It
must never contain secret values or private deployment details.
